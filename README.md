# Life Expectancy Analysis and Prediction
This project focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors to predict the life expectancy of a country.
This project was done as a part of a Hackathon conducted in my University, Christ University.



**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Several research on the factors influencing life expectancy have been conducted in the past,taking into account demographic demographics, income composition, and mortality rates. It was discovered that the impact of vaccinations and the human development index had not previously been taken into consideration. 
Additionally, a number of earlier studies used data from all the countries collected over the course of one year. So, the data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries were collected, in order to address the previously mentioned problems. Hepatitis B, polio, and diphtheria vaccinations are also important to consider. In essence, this study will concentrate on elements connected to immunisation, mortality, the economy, society, and other aspects of health. A country will find it easier to identify the predicting factor causing a lower value of life expectancy as the observations in this dataset are based on multiple countries. This will assist in recommending to a nation which region should be prioritised in order to effectively raise the population's life expectancy.
